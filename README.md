# Maple Orthogonal Polynomials Examples

This repository contains examples of partial sums of orthogonal polynomials, including Hermite, Charlier, and Lommel polynomials. Each example includes Maple code with detailed comments explaining the steps involved. The plots are done with a Python script.

## Three main Examples:

1. `Hermite.mw`
2. `Charlier.mw`
3. `Lommel.mw`

### 1. Hermite Polynomials Example (`Hermite.mw`)

This file demonstrates how to work with Hermite polynomials in Maple. It includes the following steps:

- **Defining the partial sums q**:

- **Simplifications and Verifications**: Simplifying and verifying expressions related to the recurrence relations.

- **Derivatives of \( q \)**: Computing and simplifying derivatives of the function \( q \).

- **Computation of the critical time \( t_c \)**: Using fsolve to find roots and compute the discriminant of \( q \).

### 2. Charlier Polynomials Example (`Charlier.mw`)

This file contains code for working with Charlier polynomials. The main steps include:

- **Defining the partial sums q**:

- **Simplifications and Verifications**: Simplifying and verifying expressions related to the recurrence relations.

- **Derivatives of \( q \)**: Computing and simplifying differences of the function \( q \).

### 3. Lommel Polynomials Example (`Lommel.mw`)

This file provides an example of working with Lommel polynomials in Maple. It includes:

- **Defining the partial sums q**:

- **Simplifications and Verifications**: Simplifying and verifying expressions related to the recurrence relations.
